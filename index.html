      <p>I have been fortunate enough to travel all over the world, and nowhere has captured my heart quite like South Africa. In total, I have spent almost 2 months there and have seen many different areas. My first trip to this wonderful country was in 2015 to visit a dear friend who is from Johannesburg. We traveled to Kruger National Park to see the wildlife, then traveled farther north-east to go hiking. The second trip was over the 2017/2018 holiday and New Years. I stayed with my friend's family down on the southern coast, then we took a road trip all over the South. We covered the Garden Route and ended up in Cape Town. Below you can view some of my favorite photos that I took along these travels. Just select a location to learn more and view the highlights!</p>
